Description:

This plugin provides a connection from and to the dbus message system.

Howto:

This version has three functions that could be triggered by dbus-send binary. To
test them you have to execute one of the following comands.

dbus-send --dest=org.vdr.Events --type=method_call /org/vdr/Events org.vdr.Event.shutdown int32:25
dbus-send --dest=org.vdr.Events --type=method_call /org/vdr/Events org.vdr.Event.reboot
dbus-send --dest=org.vdr.Events --type=method_call /org/vdr/Events org.vdr.Event.suspend

And by the way:

it's done when it's done :)
